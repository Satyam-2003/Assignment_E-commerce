# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Frontend:
For the frontend, I have employed React, leveraging its component-based architecture to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. This allows for seamless navigation and an intuitive user experience.

# Backend:
The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, providing a robust and scalable server-side solution. This setup ensures efficient handling of API requests, user authentication, and database interactions.

# Features:
User Management: Secure user authentication and profile management.
Product Listings: Dynamic display of food items with categories and detailed descriptions.
Cart Functionality: Users can add items to the cart, manage quantities, and proceed to checkout.
Order Processing: Real-time order tracking and history.
This project showcases the integration of various modern web technologies to create a full-fledged application that is both scalable and maintainable. I am thrilled to have implemented a complete solution from frontend to backend, including payment processing, and look forward to exploring further enhancements and features.
